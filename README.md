### Problem: Amity Delivery Service

Amity decides to introduce new delivery services to the market in order to support the growth of
the e-commerce business in Thailand. Duet o the innovative nature of the company, the ways to
u se their service is a very innovative one.
To use Amity Delivery Service, their customers have to define the delivery route by themselves.
They can construct it by choosing multiple routes between the two towns that Amity provided.
The delivery cost is equal t o the summation of these routes that t hey have chosen.
Each route in the list is only ‘one-way’. A route from town A to town B does not imply the
existence of a route from town B to t own A. Even if both o f these routes do exist, they are
distinct and are not necessarily have the exact cost.
The purpose of these assignments is to help A mity building a system t hat provides its customers
with information about the delivery routes. You will compute the delivery cost of the specific
route and the number of possible delivery route s between two towns.
